# de_novo_assembly_tutorial
The process of de novo genome assembly from the Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e isolate using only short Illumina reads (SRR1982238) is considered. The spades assembler was used. An example of using a reference genome from a homologous species (ASM19603v1) to complete the assembly is also provided (using ragtag, syri, and plotsr).
